was removed from the\nthrone.\nFrom Garrison Town to Empire: The Expansion of the Delhi Sultanate\nIn the early 13th century-control of the Delhi Sultans rarely went beyond heavily fortified towns\noccupied by garrisons- Sultans seldom controlled the hinterland of the cities-were dependent upon\ntrade, tribute or plunder for supplies-was difficult to control garrison towns in distant Bengal and Sind\nfrom Delhi-Rebellion, war, even bad weather caused disconnection of fragile communication routes-\nDelhi\u2019s authority challenged by Mongol invasions from Afghanistan and by governors who rebelled at\nany sign of the Sultan\u2019s weakness-The Sultanate barely survived this challenges-consolidation occurred\nduring the reign of Ghiyasuddin Balban and further expansion under Alauddin Khalji and Muhammad\nTughluq- first set of campaigns along the \u201cinternal frontier\u201d of the Sultanate aimed at consolidating the\nhinterlands of the garrison towns-campaigns involved forests being cleared in the Ganga-Yamuna doab\nand expulsion of hunter-gatherers and pastoralists from their habitat-lands were given to peasants-\nagriculture encouraged-New fortresses, garrison towns and towns were established to protect trade\nroutes-to promote regional trade-second expansion occurred along the \u201cexternal frontier\u201d of the\nSultanate-Military expeditions into southern India started during the reign of Alauddin Khalji-\nculminated with Muhammad Tughluq-In their campaigns, Sultanate armies captured elephants, horses\nand slaves and carried away precious metals-By the end of Muhammad Tughluq\u2019s reign, the armies of\nthe Delhi Sultanate had marched across a large part of the subcontinent-defeated rival armies and\nseized cities-Sultanate collected taxes from the peasantry and dispensed justice in its realm.\nThe Masjid\nA mosque called a masjid in Arabic, is a place where a Muslim prostrates in reverence to

accession of a new monarch often saw conflict between the old and the new nobility.\nPatronage of these humble people by the Delhi Sultans shocked many elites and the authors of Persian\ntawarikh criticised the Delhi Sultans for appointing the \u201clow and base-born\u201d to high offices.\nThe Khalji and Tughluq monarchs appointed military commanders as governors of territories of varying\nsizes (called iqta) and their holder was called iqtadar or muqti- duty of the muqtis to lead military\ncampaigns and maintain law and order in their iqtas-In exchange for their military services, the muqtis\ncollected the revenues of their assignments as salary-paid their soldiers from this revenues-to make the\ncontrol over muqtis most effective their office was not inheritable-they were assigned iqtas for a short\nperiod of time before being shifted-appointed accountant checked the amount of revenue collected by\nthe muqtis-As the Delhi Sultans brought the hinterland of the cities under their control, they forced the\nlanded chieftains \u2013 the Samanta aristocrats and rich landlords to accept their authority-Under Alauddin\nKhalji, the state brought the assessment and collection of land revenue under its own control- rights of\nthe local chieftains to levy taxes cancelled and were also forced to pay taxes-Some of the old chieftains\nand landlords serve the Sultanate as revenue collectors and assessors.\nThere were three types of taxes: (1) on cultivation called kharaj and amounting to about 50% of the\npeasant\u2019s produce, (2) on cattle and (3) on houses-Large parts of the subcontinent remained outside the\ncontrol of the Delhi Sultans-was difficult to control distant provinces like Bengal from Delhi-after\nannexing southern India, the entire region became independent- In the Gangetic plain, there were\nforested areas that Sultanate forces could not penetrate- Local chieftains established their rule in these\nregions-Rulers like Alauddin Khalji and Muhammad Tughluq could force their control for a short\nduration in these areas.\n1219- Mongols under Genghis Khan invaded Transoxiana in north-east Iran-Delhi Sultanate faced their\nonslaught soon after-Mongol attacks on the Delhi Sultanate increased during the reign of Alauddin\nKhalji and in the early years of Muhammad Tughluq\u2019s rule-forced the two rulers to mobilise a large\nstanding army in Delhi which posed a huge administrative challenge.\nSee, below how both the sultans dealt with these administrative challenges:Alauddin\u2019s defensive measures-Muhammad Tughluq\u2019s measures were a military offensive against the\nMongols.\nThe Sultanate in the 15th and 16th Centuries\nTughluqs, the Sayyid and Lodi dynasties ruled from Delhi and Agra until 1526- Jaunpur, Bengal, Malwa,\nGujarat, Rajasthan and entire south India had independent rulers in this time - they established\nflourishing states and prosperous capitals- period saw the emergence of new ruling groups like the\nAfghans and the Rajputs-small but powerful and extremely well
